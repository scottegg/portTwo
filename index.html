			<p>Hello, thank you for stopping by!  I'm a newly minted coding nerd looking to do some big things for a company looking to do the same.  My coding journey started back in the summer looking for ways to utilize big data and how to compile it.  As I learned after completing some Python challenges, I needed some in person help.  That led me to joining Tech Talent South in October.  It was quite a leap to completely leave everything I had known to enter this developer realm.  A few short months later, I couldn't be happier.  I'm coding constantly and learning new ways to do things.  I hope to become a coding genius before too long. <br>
			<br>Before all this coding, I was a sales engineer for four years and a property insurance adjuster just before that.  My glory days were spent at Clemson University where I majored in Ceramics and Materials Engineering.  I love my Tigers and a lot of my time is spent at football games.  While I call Charlotte home now, I grew up in a small town called Bluefield, VA.  If you know where that is, I'll be very impressed. <br>
			<br>To give you a deeper dive into my life, I'll give you a few fun facts.  I love television and movies.  You'll hear me spitting out quotes left and right.  I've been told it's a problem, but I don't see it.  I use exercise as damage control for my love of tasty treats.  I volunteer for Make-A-Wish Foundation here in Charlotte and it's a blast!  Those are some teaser facts.  If you want to learn anything else, feel free to ask.</p>
